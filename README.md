# Uncovering-Manipulated-Files-Using-Mathematical-Natural-Laws
This study proposes a method to detect manipulated files using Benfordâ€™s Law and statistical distance functions. By analyzing deviations from natural digit distributions, the approach reliably distinguishes benign from altered files, offering a robust alternative to machine learning in cybersecurity and digital forensics.
