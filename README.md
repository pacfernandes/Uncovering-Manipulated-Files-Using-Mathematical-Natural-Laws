# Uncovering-Manipulated-Files-Using-Mathematical-Natural-Laws
This work introduces an innovative methodology for detecting manipulated files by applying Benford’s Law and other mathematical natural laws to the statistical analysis of numerical patterns. The model relies on the premise that legitimate files tend to follow predictable digit distributions, while tampered or malicious files exhibit statistically significant deviations.

The approach was validated on different datasets, with a focus on manipulated PDF files, demonstrating the ability of natural laws to uncover inconsistencies and anomalies that often evade conventional detection techniques. Results show that applying statistical distance functions (such as KL divergence, Jensen-Shannon, MAD, and Pearson correlation) to Benford’s Law enables a reliable distinction between benign and altered files.

Beyond providing a machine-learning-independent and robust solution for imbalanced or limited data scenarios, this study opens new avenues for the use of mathematical statistics in cybersecurity and digital forensics, with direct implications for fraud and malware detection in digital documents.
